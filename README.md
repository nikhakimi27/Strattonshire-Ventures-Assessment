# Strattonshire-Ventures-Assessment

A simple project using The Movie DB using Kotlin and Android for Mobile App Developer position at Strattonshire-Ventures.

## Development Process

### Step 1: Learning the Basics
Started by following YouTube guides to build a simple RecyclerView list.
### Step 2: Implementing API Requests
Expanded the app's functionality by learning how to make API requests using OkHttp and Retrofit, following more YouTube guides.
### Step 3: Troubleshooting and Project Restructuring
Encountered an issue with the main layout (activity_main.xml) not loading.
Resolved the problem by creating a new project, which solved the loading issue.
### Step 4: Data Integration
Successfully retrieved data from the API and began integrating it into the app's UI.
### Step 5: Building the UI
Followed a guide from a blog to create a user interface (UI) for the app, using the activity_main.xml file.
### Step 6: Adapter Creation
Wrote an adapter to connect the UI views with the data fetched from the API.
### Step 7: Data Binding
Assigned the adapter to the UI, effectively displaying the API data on the app's interface.

## Challenges Faced:
### **1. Layout Loading Issue:**
During the early stages of development, I faced difficulty with the main layout (activity_main.xml) not loading properly. This issue halted progress until I decided to create a new project, which ultimately resolved the loading problem.
### **2. Adaptability:**
Since Kotlin used OOP and functional constructs, it was quite challenging for me to develop the app, especially when building the UI. Making adapters for certain views was pretty much new to me.
### **3. Outdated Reference:**
I develop the app and learn to use Kotlin at the same time. Thus, all my references are solely from the internet. Most of the sources are outdated and some of the functions that the guides used are deprecated. This is of course also my fault as I should have referred to the official Kotlin guide from Android.

## Open-Source Libraries:
- [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for movie database API service
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) for constructing the REST API
- [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for data exchanges (TMDB provides example using OkHttp)
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for loading images

## Conclusion
This development process demonstrates my ability to learn new skills through online resources and adapt to challenges encountered during the development of the mobile app. I'm happy that I get this opportunity to try out Kotlin works, and I'm more than keen to continue my journey on using this tech.
